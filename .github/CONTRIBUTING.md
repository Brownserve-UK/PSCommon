# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome but please do bear in mind that these tools are designed specifically to work with Brownserve projects and are in use across various production CI/CD pipelines, therefore we may not be able to accommodate all requests.

Code should follow the guidelines below and must have complete documentation before being submitted (it will fail CI/CD if it doesn't).
Documentation will be generated for you when you run the `BuildWithDocs` task locally however some sections will be missing and will need to be completed manually.
For more information on how to run builds, see the build tasks defined in [`.build/tasks/build_tasks.ps1`](../.build/tasks/build_tasks.ps1).

>**ℹ Please Note:**
Our branch protection rules **require** all commits to be [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).  
While we can rebase and sign commits for you it's much more likely that your PR will be merged promptly if you ensure your commits are signed before submitting the PR.

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for PR titles and **this is a hard requirement.** Your PR title must begin with a recognised prefix so that an automated workflow can classify the change for the changelog. A second check will block merge if no valid label has been applied.

Supported prefixes (brackets are optional):

| Prefix examples | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `[feat]:` `feat:` `[feature]:` `feature:` | New feature or enhancement |
| `[fix]:` `fix:` `[bug]:` `bug:` | Bug fix |
| `[docs]:` `docs:` `[doc]:` `doc:` | Documentation update |
| `[ci]:` `ci:` `[cicd]:` `cicd:` | CI/CD changes |
| `[chore]:` `[refactor]:` `[ops]:` `[test]:` `[style]:` (and without brackets) | Maintenance |

Add `!` before the colon to flag a breaking change, e.g. `[feat!]: remove legacy parameter` or `fix!: rename cmdlet`.

>**ℹ Please Note:**
If your PR title does not match a recognised prefix the check will fail and a comment will be posted on the PR explaining what to fix. Simply update the title and the checks will re-run automatically.

## Style Guidelines

### Writing cmdlets

#### Don't construct paths manually

Don't form paths by passing in separators (e.g. `C:\`, `/usr/`), use the tools PowerShell gives you:

* [`Resolve-Path`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/resolve-path?view=powershell-7.1) can be used to validate user submitted paths or resolve the path to commands/aliases.
* [`Join-Path`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/join-path?view=powershell-7.1) can be used to construct paths _(top tip: you can specify multiple values in_ `-AdditionalChildPaths`)
* [`Convert-Path`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/convert-path?view=powershell-7.1) by default PowerShell stores paths as a `PSPath` which can break environment variables, Convert-Path converts a `PSPath` to the standard path format for your OS.

All these cmdlets will handle the path separators for you and will ensure that the path is valid for the current operating system.
By using these you give your code a much higher chance of working across different operating systems.

#### OS specific cmdlets

By default we treat all cmdlets as cross-platform but there may be instances where your code will only work on certain operating systems (e.g. `Install-ChocolateyPackage`), in these cases you should call `Test-OperatingSystem` at the beginning of your cmdlet with the supported OSes as the first (and only) parameter.
If the current OS isn't in the supported list then an exception will be raised.

**Example:**  
In this example we're running on a Linux based operating system so the cmdlet will run successfully:

```powershell
> $isLinux
> $True
> Test-OperatingSystem 'Linux','macOS' -Verbose
> VERBOSE: This cmdlet is supported on Linux
```

Moving over to a Windows based operating system we can see that the cmdlet will now throw an exception:

```powershell
> $isWindows
> $True
> Test-OperatingSystem 'Linux','macOS' -Verbose
> Exception: This cmdlet is not compatible with Windows
```

#### Use `Start`, `Process` and `End` blocks

Even if your cmdlet doesn't support pipeline input you should still use the `Start`, `Process` and `End` blocks.
This allows us to easily add support for pipeline input in the future and keeps the code consistent.

#### Define parameter properties

When defining parameters you should always define the parameter properties, including the `Mandatory`, `Position` and `ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName` properties where applicable.

#### Define parameter types

When defining parameters you should always define the parameter type, this allows PowerShell to validate the input and provide tab completion.

#### Ensure parameter names are consistent

When defining parameters you should ensure that the parameter names are consistent across all cmdlets, for example if you have a parameter called `Token` in one cmdlet then you should use `Token` in all cmdlets, not `PAT` or `AccessToken` etc.

### Writing Documentation

#### All `Public` cmdlets **must** have documentation

All `Public` cmdlets **must** have documentation, and all documentation **must** be complete (this will fail CI/CD if it isn't).
Running any of the build tasks will automatically generate the documentation for you, however some sections will be missing and will need to be completed manually. These will be surrounded by `{{ }}` to make them easy to find (e.g. `{{ Fill in Synopsis }}`).
There are some tests as part of the `BuildAndTest` task will check for incomplete sections and highlight them in the build output.

#### Keep the synopsis short

The synopsis should be a concise basic description of what the cmdlet does.
Ideally it should be kept to a single line but sometimes a slightly more verbose synopsis may be warranted.

#### Documentation must use LF line endings

Unfortunately for files created by PowerShell (such as our documentation) the line endings will always be set to the line endings of the operating system that was in use when they were generated (see <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2872>).
Therefore to ensure the line endings stay consistent (so we can avoid a messy git history) we require that all documentation is generated with LF line endings.
To make this easier we include an [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file in the repository which will automatically set the line endings to LF for those files.
For those not using an editor that supports editorconfig then the build tasks should automatically convert the line endings for you.
