                Use regex to parse the line.
                This isn't the prettiest and here be dragons.
                At the moment we're quite liberal with what we match as it's easier to write simpler regex and then
                try to catch the edge cases later.
                For example writing regex to match all possible list types might accidentally catch a horizontal rule
                so instead of trying to filter that out in the regex we just check for it later with more specific
                regex and move on if it's a match.
                We also don't fully support every case in markdownlint yet, PR's are very much welcome.
