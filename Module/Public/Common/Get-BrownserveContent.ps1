.SYNOPSIS
    Wrapper for Get-Content that returns the content in a format that is easier to work with.
.DESCRIPTION
    This cmdlet ensures that any content is returned in a format that is easy to work with in pipelines.
    It stores the content as a string array so it can be easily iterated over while stripping any line breaks.
    It also detects the line endings of the file and stores that information in the returned object so the file can
    be saved with the same line endings.

            $Path | ForEach-Object {
                # Store the content without line breaks, it's easier to work with
                # $Content = Get-Content -Path $_ -ErrorAction 'Stop' -ReadCount 0 -Force
                <#
                    Despite Get-Content supporting delimiting the content on line breaks we end up with a interesting
                    issue - if the file ends with a string and a new line marker then the subsequent new line is not
                    included in the content.
                    (e.g:
                    "This is the last line`n
                    "
                    would return:
                    "This is the last line"
                    )
                    This is especially problematic when we run the Initialize-BrownserveRepository cmdlet that compares
                    the content of the files in the repository to the content of the auto generated templates.
                    So instead we read the file in RAW mode and then split the content on the line breaks.
                    This is basically the same as what Get-Content does but we can ensure that the last line is included.
                #>
                $Content = (Get-Content -Path $_ -ErrorAction 'Stop' -Raw -Force -ReadCount 0) -split "`n"
                # Read the content as a byte stream so we can properly detect the line endings
                $ByteStreamContent = Get-Content -Path $_ -ErrorAction 'Stop' -Raw -AsByteStream -Force
                $LFCount = 0
                $CRCount = 0
                foreach ($Byte in $ByteStreamContent)
                {
                    # A LF byte is 10, a CR byte is 13
                    if ($Byte -eq 10)
                    {
                        $LFCount++
                    }
                    elseif ($Byte -eq 13)
                    {
                        $CRCount++
                    }
                }
                # Check to see if we have any carriage returns
                if ($CRCount -gt 0)
                {
                    <#
                        We ALWAYS strip out CR characters from the content.
                        This is done as if we don't then when writing the file back to disk we end up with a file that has
                        double CR characters. (e.g. `r`n becomes `r`r`n)
                        It also makes it easier to work with the content as we don't have to worry about the line endings when
                        comparing strings, we can just compare the strings directly.
                        If we care about comparing the line endings then we can use the LineEnding property of the returned object.

                    $Content = $Content -replace "\r", ''
                    # If we do then check to see if we have any line feeds as well
                    if ($LFCount -gt 0)
                    {
                        # If we have the same number of carriage returns and line feeds then we have a CRLF file
                        if ($CRCount -eq $LFCount)

                            Looks like we have a file with mixed line endings 😬
                            We'll set it to use our default line ending of LF and warn the user that the
                            Set-BrownserveContent cmdlet will save the file with the new line endings.
                            (This can be overridden by specifying the -LineEnding parameter when calling Format-BrownserveContent)

                        Somehow we have a file with no line endings!?
                        It's possible this file is just one line, in which case we'll set it to use our
                        default line ending of LF.
