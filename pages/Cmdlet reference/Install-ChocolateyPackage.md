# Install-ChocolateyPackage

## SYNOPSIS

Helper cmdlet for installing Chocolatey packages programmatically

## SYNTAX

### default (Default)

```text
Install-ChocolateyPackage [-PackageName] <String> [[-PackageVersion] <String>] [-Upgrade]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### pipeline

```text
Install-ChocolateyPackage [-Upgrade] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This cmdlet is intended to be used in automations to allow for easy installations of dependencies.
It's primary use case is for cloud based build agents that may not necessarily have all the required tooling available by default, though it can also be used to bulk install chocolatey packages on your local machine if you wish.
Given that Chocolatey is package manager for Windows this cmdlet is Windows Only.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Install a given package

```powershell
PS C:\> Install-ChocolateyPackage -PackageName 'awscli'
```

This would install the latest version of the `awscli` on the local system

### Example 2: Upgrade a package if it's already installed

```powershell
PS C:\> Install-ChocolateyPackage -PackageName 'awscli' -Upgrade
```

This would install the latest version of the `awscli` on the local system if it is not already installed, if it is installed but is not the latest version it will be updated

### Example 3: Bulk install packages

```powershell
PS C:\> @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        name = 'awscli'
        version = 'any'
    }],
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Name = 'git'
        version = '1.0.0'
    }]
) | Install-ChocolateyPackages
```

This would install the latest version of the `awscli` on the local system and version `1.0.0` of git if they do not already exist

### Example 4: Passing in from a CSV

```powershell
PS C:\packages\> Import-CSV 'choco_packages.csv' | Install-ChocolateyPackages
```

Providing the csv file was structured correctly this would bulk install any packages from the CSV file.
